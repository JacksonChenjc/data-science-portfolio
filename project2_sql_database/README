# 🧩 Academic Data Query System (COMP9311)

**Tools:** SQL, PostgreSQL, PL/pgSQL  
**Goal:** Build analytical SQL views and stored procedures for a university academic dataset to extract insights on students, courses, and staff.

---

## 📘 Overview
This project was part of UNSW’s Database Systems course (COMP9311).  
It focuses on designing complex SQL queries and stored functions to analyze relationships in an academic database containing students, courses, and staff data.

The implementation includes:
- **10 analytical views (Q1–Q8)** for academic statistics and comparisons  
- **2 procedural functions (Q9–Q10)** using PL/pgSQL for dynamic query generation

## 🧠 Key Features

| Query | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Q1** | Find COMP-equivalent subjects offered by a specific school. |
| **Q2** | Identify lab-based courses where all labs use unique rooms. |
| **Q3** | Find students taught by professors across multiple semesters. |
| **Q4** | Retrieve students enrolled in both a Major and a Research stream. |
| **Q5** | Identify students scoring ≥98 in subjects outside their faculty. |
| **Q6** | Compare schools by number of buildings used for teaching. |
| **Q7** | Retrieve courses with the most facilities and related staff. |
| **Q8** | Find students who graduated with a Bachelor but not Master (before 2012). |
| **Q9** | Function: Return tutors’ info and employment duration for a given student. |
| **Q10** | Function: Return students with average marks >85 for a given term and school. |
