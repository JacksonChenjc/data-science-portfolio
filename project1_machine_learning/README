# ðŸ§  9417 Machine Learning Project â€” Robust Feedback Classification

This project was developed as part of my Master of Data Science coursework at UNSW.  
It focuses on **classifying customer feedback** into 28 categories using **machine learning (ML)** and **deep learning (DL)** models under **imbalanced and shifted data distributions**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to automatically classify customer feedback data, which has **imbalanced class distribution** and **shifted features**, into 28 meaningful categories.

To address these challenges, several models were compared:
- **Logistic Regression (LR)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** with **Focal Loss**, **Dropout**, and **Early Stopping**

The final model combined **Random Forest feature selection** with a **DNN architecture**, achieving the best performance.

## ðŸ§© My Contribution

I was mainly responsible for the **RF + DNN hybrid model**, including:
- Implementing **Focal Loss** to handle imbalanced labels  
- Applying **feature importanceâ€“based selection (top 200 features)** from Random Forest  
- Training and fine-tuning the **Deep Neural Network (PyTorch)**  
- Generating evaluation metrics and visualizations (confusion matrix, classification report)
