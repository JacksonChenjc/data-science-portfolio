### My Contribution
I was responsible for the **RF_DNN model**:
- Applied Random Forest for feature importance ranking and selected top 200 features as input.
- Built and optimized a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with standardized features.
- Integrated Focal Loss to handle class imbalance, significantly improving minority class recall.
- Achieved the best overall performance: Validation Accuracy 0.78, Unweighted F1 0.4726, and lowest Cross-Entropy Loss (0.0068).
